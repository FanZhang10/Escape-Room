# Escape-Room

Creating an adventure game in Prolog. There are more than 10 unique rooms that the player can enter into and exit. When the player enter a room, the game will print a description of the room, a list of all objects (inventory items, keys, etc) contained in the room, and a list of all paths out of the room. The player can find some limited resources, such as hit points, flashlight batteries, torches, rope for climbing. A collection of resources the player can holds. The resources can run out of or are optionally renewable by exploring certain areas in the game. The player has conditional movement, which means he/she is not allowed to move in a certain direction unless he/she has satisfied some condition. Maybe the player need a certain inventory item.  The goal of the game is to find clues and escape from this enclosed rooms
